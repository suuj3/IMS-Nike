            <h3>PURCHASING PRODUCTS</h3>

            <p>NO PURCHASE FOR RESALE</p>
            
            <p>NIKE Stores, including any consumer rights or policies offered in NIKE Stores, are intended solely for the benefit of end consumers, and therefore purchase of products for resale is strictly prohibited. Purchase for resale means the purchase of product by someone who intends to resell the product to others (consumers, businesses or any third party).  If NIKE determines that a purchase or order is intended for resale, NIKE reserves the right, in its sole discretion, and as it relates to such purchase or order, to (1) suspend the application of any NIKE policy that provides a right or benefit intended for direct to consumer purchases; and (2) take any action to hinder such purchase or order (and deter future purchases or orders), including without limitation, to restrict sales to any consumer, consumer account, or member account, cancel orders, charge restocking fees, impose purchase quantity limits, decline to issue refunds or take returns, deny access to any NIKE Store, and/or suspend or close any account.</p>
            
            <p></p>HOW TO PURCHASE– DIGITAL STORES </p>
            
            <p></p>To complete your purchase at a Digital Store, you must provide your full name, e-mail address, valid delivery address, and payment method to place an online order. You may need to adjust your device settings or set your browser to accept functional cookies and pop-ups in order to be able to use all the functionalities of a Digital Store, which includes designing customized items, adding items to your shopping bag and submitting your order. 
            
            When you submit an order, we will send an email acknowledging receipt of your order (“Order Confirmation”).  Our acceptance of your order takes place when the products are shipped to you; we will send a second email confirming that the products have been shipped. If we are unable to supply you with a product, we will inform you of this in writing and will not process the order for that product. </p>
            
            <p>OUR RIGHT TO REJECT YOUR PURCHASE OR CANCEL AN ORDER</p>
            <p>Sale of products and fulfillment of all orders at a NIKE Store is subject to availability and our discretion in managing inventory. We explicitly reserve the right to limit, decline or reject any sales and orders for any reason, without being liable for any damage or costs other than repayment of any amount received from you in relation to such sale or order, in situations including but not limited to:
            
            an Event Outside Our Control (as defined below);
            the product you seek to purchase is not available or in stock;
            your address, billing information or form of payment is incorrect or cannot be verified;
            your order is flagged by our security systems as potentially fraudulent, or an order placed with automated ordering software or technology;
            there is evidence that your order (single or cumulative orders) was purchased for the purpose of resale, tax evasion, or other fraudulent purpose;
            your order was flagged for freight forwarding or shipping to an address or service provider that enables or allows foreign export or unlawful avoidance of sales tax;
            your purchase or order exceeds product purchase limits (quantity and/or dollar amount);
            your account and/or purchase history shows an excessively high volume of returns;
            there is evidence that you are not eligible to make purchases; or
            in the event of misspelling, pricing or other errors or mistakes at the NIKE Store(s) where you wish to order or purchase.
            NIKE will determine whether any of the above events have occurred in its sole discretion.</p>
            
             
            
            TITLE TRANSFER & RISK OF LOSS
            
            With the exception of products purchased or picked up at NIKE Stores, title and risk of loss for products purchased from NIKE pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.  Title and risk of loss for products purchased online and picked up at NIKE Retail Stores or directly purchased at NIKE Retail stores will pass to you upon your authorized receipt of those products.  Title to product(s) will not transfer until full payment has been received.
